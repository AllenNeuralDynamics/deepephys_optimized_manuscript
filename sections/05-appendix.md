# Appendix

## A. Model glossary

All models are the `fold` DeepInterpolation ephys denoiser (channels scattered on the NP1 grid, W
columns folded into the feature axis, a 1-D U-Net along probe depth, fused per channel with a
probe-axis blind-spot branch). Every override is defined in
[the pre-registered design](reproducibility/regeneration-plan.md) §4.

**Scored (Tier 1 + Tier 2 + SUPPORT scale).**
- **base32** — the reference: `base_channels=32, depth=3`, 3-frame temporal blind spot
  (`omission=1`), `bs_channels=64 / bs_depth=5`, `fuse_channels=64`, Charbonnier loss. In-band
  d′ 4.277 ± 0.015, amp 0.859 (5 seeds).
- **omission0** — base32 with the omission gap removed (`omission=0`, which also forces a 1-frame
  blind spot): the temporal branch now sees t±1. d′ 4.312, amp 0.932 (5 seeds).
- **champ_l2** — base32 with L2/MSE instead of Charbonnier; nothing else changed. d′ 4.289,
  amp 0.861 (3 seeds; the study's noisiest replicate set, σ = 0.041).
- **omission0_l2** — omission0 in L2, completing the loss × omission 2×2. d′ 4.305, amp 0.931 (3 seeds).
- **base64** — base32 with the U-Net base width doubled (32 → 64, 3.15 M params). d′ 4.382,
  amp 0.880 (3 seeds).
- **arch** — the enlarged body: base 64, depth 4, `bs_channels=128`, `bs_depth=7`. d′ 4.409, amp 0.871
  — the top detector; L2 twin `arch_l2` 4.407.
- **base64_om0 / arch_om0** — the two capacity bodies with the omission gap removed (`omission=0`,
  1-frame blind spot). d′ 4.359 / 4.367, amp 0.934 / 0.936 — capacity's detection with omission0's
  amplitude rescue.
- **SUPPORT wiring / fuse width / temporal (Tier 2, single seed).** `support_sd` 4.313, `support_all`
  4.312, `support_all_l2` 4.295 (larger, denser blind-spot branch); `fuse256` 4.265, `fuse256_l2`
  4.282, `fuse512` 4.244 (wider fusion); `tmult8` 4.257 (deeper temporal hand-off); `no_norm` 4.284;
  `ho` 4.272 (1-frame blind spot, omission on). None clears the base32 band; amp ~0.86 throughout.
- **om0_scale / om1_scale** — the two SUPPORT-scale runs (`support_all` wiring, L2, ~3.3 M updates)
  with `omission=0` / `omission=1`; the saturation A/B. Final-step d′ 4.361 / 4.361; amp 0.939 / 0.870.

**Pending (Tier 3).** The spike-weight amp-lever family (`weighted`, `l10g1/g2`, `archL10`, `hard1000`,
`uL100`, and the `uL100_om0` combo) plus L2 pairs — defined in the plan, not yet scored.

## B. Per-unit amplitude across models

`amp_ratio` for each ground-truth unit (rows, sorted by baseline separability = intrinsic unit
quality) across a representative set of the **short-budget** models; seeds averaged. The two
SUPPORT-scale runs are excluded here (different training budget — see the training-length section);
the full matrix across every run is in `results/tables/perunit_amp.csv`.

| unit | base d′ | base32 | omission0 | champ_l2 | omission0_l2 | base64 | arch | base64_om0 | arch_om0 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2143 | 12.53 | 1.005 | 0.990 | 1.001 | 0.987 | 1.011 | 1.016 | 0.991 | 0.988 |
| 793 | 8.57 | 1.003 | 0.962 | 1.005 | 0.957 | 1.012 | 1.015 | 0.962 | 0.971 |
| 1143 | 5.32 | 0.918 | 0.957 | 0.923 | 0.957 | 0.921 | 0.915 | 0.959 | 0.963 |
| 1300 | 4.07 | 0.872 | 0.952 | 0.873 | 0.950 | 0.880 | 0.872 | 0.947 | 0.951 |
| 1122 | 3.80 | 0.852 | 0.924 | 0.855 | 0.925 | 0.880 | 0.883 | 0.929 | 0.934 |
| 337 | 3.15 | 0.915 | 0.948 | 0.917 | 0.947 | 0.937 | 0.925 | 0.953 | 0.948 |
| 720 | 2.18 | 0.775 | 0.891 | 0.781 | 0.897 | 0.804 | 0.786 | 0.897 | 0.893 |
| 94 | 2.17 | 0.807 | 0.971 | 0.806 | 0.968 | 0.818 | 0.812 | 0.964 | 0.973 |
| 1129 | 2.14 | 0.670 | 0.831 | 0.675 | 0.834 | 0.723 | 0.687 | 0.833 | 0.823 |
| 664 | 1.04 | 0.773 | 0.889 | 0.772 | 0.890 | 0.817 | 0.798 | 0.910 | 0.910 |
| **mean** | — | 0.859 | 0.932 | 0.861 | 0.931 | 0.880 | 0.871 | 0.934 | 0.936 |

The dominant structure is **vertical, not horizontal**: strong units (top) return near 1.0 in *every*
model, weak units (bottom) are smoothed to 0.67–0.82 in the base32-body configs — amplitude
undershoot is a property of the *unit*, not the architecture (Spearman with baseline d′ = 0.94). The
one lever that shifts a column is the omission gap: `omission0` lifts precisely the weak
units (1129 0.67 → 0.83, 94 0.81 → 0.97) while leaving strong units unchanged; `base64` and `arch`
lift them only mildly (capacity barely touches the shrinkage); `champ_l2` tracks base32 almost exactly;
and the combos `base64_om0` / `arch_om0` reproduce the full omission lift at high capacity (94 → 0.96–0.97,
1129 → 0.82–0.83).

**Per-unit amplitude across models** (units × architectures; green ≈ preserved, red = smoothed). The
gradient is vertical (unit quality) and near-identical in every column — the undershoot is a property
of the unit, not the architecture.

## C. Per-unit detection (Δd′) across models

Change in detectability from denoising, Δd′ = d′_deep − d′_raw, per unit × representative model (seeds
averaged; full matrix in `results/tables/perunit_dprime_delta.csv`). Negative = denoising made that
unit *harder* to detect.

| unit | base d′ | base32 | omission0 | champ_l2 | omission0_l2 | base64 | arch | base64_om0 | arch_om0 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2143 | 12.53 | +0.730 | +0.087 | +0.684 | +0.023 | +1.038 | +1.345 | +0.309 | +0.286 |
| 793 | 8.57 | +0.056 | −0.298 | +0.196 | −0.327 | +0.365 | +0.564 | −0.167 | −0.101 |
| 1143 | 5.32 | −0.376 | −0.216 | −0.363 | −0.211 | −0.312 | −0.343 | −0.194 | −0.204 |
| 1300 | 4.07 | −0.480 | −0.260 | −0.483 | −0.258 | −0.421 | −0.440 | −0.245 | −0.222 |
| 1122 | 3.80 | −0.470 | −0.239 | −0.455 | −0.240 | −0.359 | −0.392 | −0.202 | −0.175 |
| 337 | 3.15 | −0.381 | −0.238 | −0.395 | −0.232 | −0.315 | −0.284 | −0.196 | −0.189 |
| 720 | 2.18 | −0.372 | −0.178 | −0.369 | −0.167 | −0.352 | −0.376 | −0.178 | −0.173 |
| 94 | 2.17 | −0.246 | −0.139 | −0.246 | −0.140 | −0.233 | −0.302 | −0.144 | −0.146 |
| 1129 | 2.14 | −0.496 | −0.267 | −0.482 | −0.265 | −0.419 | −0.484 | −0.272 | −0.291 |
| 664 | 1.04 | −0.166 | −0.105 | −0.165 | −0.105 | −0.139 | −0.164 | −0.089 | −0.088 |
| **mean** | — | −0.220 | −0.185 | −0.208 | −0.192 | −0.115 | −0.088 | −0.138 | −0.130 |

Two things stand out. First, **almost every cell is negative** — denoising reduces separability for
nearly every unit (the cost that motivates the whole study), with column means from −0.088 (arch) to
−0.22 (base32). Second, the damage is **not uniform**: it concentrates on the mid-to-weak
units (unit 1129 −0.50, 1300 −0.48 in base32), while the single strongest unit (2143, baseline
d′ 12.5) actually *gains* — and gains more with capacity (+0.73 base32, +1.04 base64, **+1.35 arch**) —
a well-isolated unit whose denoised template sharpens. `arch` damages least across the board (mean
**−0.088**), then `base64` (−0.115): capacity is the detection lever, and much of its edge is this
sharpening of the already-strong units. The omission configs and the `*_om0` combos sit between
(−0.13 to −0.19), their amplitude rescue not translating into detection.

**Per-unit change in detectability Δd′** (units × architectures; red = denoising hurts, blue = helps).
Almost every cell is red; the strongest unit (2143) is the exception, and `base64` is the least red.
